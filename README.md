### Flutter Arch step one

#### This has 3 state management examples
- state going down deep within parent/child widgets
- specific state management (AuthState)
- global state management

#### notes
- This has simple source structure in form of modules
- I have avoided using external dependency
- using Stream, Instances and InheritedWidget
